# Project Overview
This project contains code for data extraction, cleaning, model fitting, analysis, and image processing related to:

- Mechanical properties of in-vivo models across different length-scales
- Morphological and viability properties of multicellular objects, and its correlation with mechanical properties of in-vivo models
- Time-series data

Important Note: This code is associated with an unpublished work of my PhD. It is intended for reference purposes only. Please do not use or distribute this code until the publication is officially released. Thank you for your understanding.
